# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Housing-Company
This case study is based on giving a predicting model to the housing company regarding the houses listed on thier resgistrar.
It is a multi-linear regression model in which the dependant(variable to be predicted) is "Price of the houses" .
There are multiple predictor variables like "number of bedrooms', "parking area", "number of bathrooms" etc.
It also contains a predicting model built usinbg RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) where variables are chosen by automated and manual way.
Automation is used to eliminate redundant variables wheres maunal elimination is done to do fine tuning to the model.
